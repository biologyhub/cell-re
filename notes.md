## History of Biochemistry
- 1833, Anselme Payen
  - discovery of amylase
- 1897, Eduard Buchner
  - discovery of alcoholic fermentation biochemical process
- 1926, James B. Sumner
  - crystallized urease and showed it was pure protein
  - established that proteins may be enzymes, not just enzyme
    carriers
- 1960, Robert K. Crane
  - discovery of sodium-glucose cotransport as mechanism for
    intestinal glucose absorption
- Gustav Embden, Otto Meyerhof, Jakob Karol Parnas,
  - discovery of glycolysis pathway
- 1983, Kary Mullis
  - invention of PCR technique
